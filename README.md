# Researches upon Static Task Scheduling of Heterogeneous Parallel System

This repository is the experiment part of the 22nd ITP Project, "Optimization of distributed parallel inference system for large neural network".

The project implements Hashing, HEFT_ALAP, HEFT_ASAP, CPOP, GA and a simulation environment with realistic heterogeneous model.
